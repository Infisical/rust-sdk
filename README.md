## Introduction

**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is the open source secret management platform that teams use to centralize their secrets like API keys, database credentials, and configurations.

If youâ€™re working with Rust, the official Infisical Rust SDK package is the easiest way to fetch and work with secrets for your application. You can read the documentation [here](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/rust).

## Documentation
You can find the documentation for the Rust SDK on our [SDK documentation page](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/rust).
